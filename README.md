# shape-loader
A simple game for kids where you load shapes onto a truck

## To install dependencies and run:

    bundle install
    bundle exec ruby shape_loader.rb
    

## To play: 

- Use arrow keys to move.
- The goal is to pick up the right shapes and load them on the truck. The order matters.

## Have fun!
